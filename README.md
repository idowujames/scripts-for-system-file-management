# Scripts For System File Management

As part of automating task on my local system, I'm making a couple of fun short python scripts to automatically manage how files are stored on my system.

- The [Download Folder File Management Script](https://github.com/idowujames/scripts-for-system-file-management/blob/main/download_folder_file_management.py) helps decluter the download folder by auto-creating the necesary file-type folders and storing the corresponding files in them.

I belive alot of people have made scripts like this as I'm guessing this types of redundant tasks have being around since the dawn of time but the direct inspiration for this utility scripts come from Patrick Loeber of the [Python Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/c/pythonengineer) youtube channel.



Running the scripts as cron jobs makes life alot easier as well :wink:
